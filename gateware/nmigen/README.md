# OrangeCrab ADC nMigen gateware
This is a *very* preliminary nMigen implementation of a decimating
downconverter (DDC) for use with the OrangeCrab ADC featherwing. The system
architecture is based on the same structure that has been used for most of
the other SDR projects I've done, with some minor tweaks for the ECP5
capabilities.

Don't laugh - this is the first substantial nMigen code I've written and it's
mostly based on reading random tutorials, a few examples and banging my head
against the wall. I'm sure there's a fair amount of non-optimal coding style
in here - feel free to critque it.
